# Sieve of Eratosthenes
While learning about the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm from Hania Uscka-Wehlou's wonderful [Precalculus](https://www.udemy.com/course/precalculus-1/) course, I thought it would be fun to code it out.  

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm to find all prime numbers given a range. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)
