# Sieve of Eratosthenes
While learning about the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm from Hania Uscka-Wehlou's wonderful [Precalculus](https://www.udemy.com/course/precalculus-1/) course, I thought it would be fun to code it out.  

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm to find all prime numbers given a range. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)

The code is written using Python 3.11.3 but any version should be fine with no other python packages/modules needed. 
You run the code using the run_client.py file and changing the n to the number that you intend to find.

## run_client.py example
